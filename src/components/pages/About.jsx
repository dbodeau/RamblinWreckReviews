                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Mines currently uses CATME, Purdue Universityâ€™s team evaluation platform, but it has significant costs and lacks crucial features. We are developing an in-house peer evaluation platform that addresses these limitations and incorporates additional functionalities.</p>

                    <h2>Development History</h2>
                    <p>We are the 7th team working on this project. Previous groups have gotten this project 
                        off the ground and deployed on AWS services, yet the site lacks a majority of the 
                        funcitonality and interactions with users. Our goal is to implement
                        as much of the needed functionality with our time on this project throughout Fall '24.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Features</h2>
                    <p><strong>Administrators</strong> or Department heads will curate a catalog of pre-approved questions, define weightings to multiple choice questions and assign mandatory questions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Professors</strong> create and assign surveys, view an up-to-date completion status on surveys and their results, and modify students and TAs on a per-class basis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Students</strong> fill out peer evaluation surveys and review feedback.</p>
